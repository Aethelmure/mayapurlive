“Next to [Uchchahatta](/en/uchahatta) is Panchaveni (“five rivers”). This place is considered a place of pilgrimage for the demigods who come here to rest. At this point, the three streams of the Ganges (Bhagirathi, Bhogavati and Alakananda), Yamuna and Sarasvati (Jalanga) merge, wanting to serve Gauranga ”(Navadvipa-bhava-taranga, 62).

Five rivers flow together here. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that the glories of this place are incomparable. If a person takes bath here, he is not destined to be born again. Anyone who dies here, on earth, in water or in the air, without any effort reaches Goloka Vrndavana. Bhaktivinoda Thakura writes: “Having washed themselves here, Gauranga and His associates cleansed this tirtha from the sins of Kali-yuga. Vyasadeva and the Rishis did not see a place in all fourteen worlds that could be compared to Panchaveni ”(Navadvipa-bhava-taranga, 63). The sages, together with Lord Brahma, who have made millions of sacrifices here, call this place Maha-Prayag.

“When I wash myself in the waters of Panchaveni and remember the lotus feet of Sri Gauranga. Filling my palms with water that washed Gaura’s feet, and drunk as much as I can, I get drunk from the memories of Gauranga. When will this time come? ”(Navadvipa-bhava-taranga, 64).
