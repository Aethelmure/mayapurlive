Snana-yatra is an important pastime of Lord Jagannatha at our temple at Rajapur, Simantadvipa. On this day, Jagannatha, Baladeva, and Subhadra allow Themselves to be bathed by all following the original tradition of worship at Jagannatha Puri. Our devotees as well as hundreds of local people enthusiastically assemble at the Jagannatha temple to perform abhisheka with Ganges water, milk, etc. This bathing goes on for a few hours in the midst of kirtanas glorifying Their Lordships and the chanting of the maha-mantra. Lord Jagannatha’s prasada is also offered to all visitors.

Lord Jagannatha’s pastimes are such that after snana-yatra, Jagannatha, Balarama and Subhadra become “sick”, and, so, must take “medicines” and “take rest” until they become “rejuvenated” enough to go for Ratha-yatra. When they are “sick”, they are offered bhoga containing medicinal herbs without the usual offerings.
