On this day, 5000 years ago, on the battlefield of Kuruksetra, the [Supreme Lord](/en/krishna) delivered the most confidential and topmost knowledge of devotional service to His lotus feet in the form of the [Bhagavad-gita](/en/bhagavad-gita) to His dearmost devotee Arjuna, and to humanity at large, in order to help all devotees understand the purpose of life and the way to surrender to Him.

A gita-yajna is performed at Mayapur while devotees recite verses from Bhagavad-gita. A Gita Book Marathon also takes place and devotees take part in actively distributing [Srila Prabhupadaâ€™s](/en/srila-prabhupada) Bhagavad-gita to visitors. Usually devotees fast till noon, go to the [Ganga](/en/ganga) for Ganga-puja and bath in her holy waters and a Harinama-sankirtana is held in the evening.
