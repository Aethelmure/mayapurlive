The main deities here are Lord Nrsimhadeva with Hiranyakasipu on his knees and Prahlada Maharaja at his feet. This self-manifest Deity exists from Satya Yuga.

A small kirtan hall was built here by The Bhaktivedanta Charity Trust.

The temple is located near the southeastern border of Navadvipa Dhama and is known as Nrsimha Puri and Devapalli ("the place where the demigods live"). There is this place from Satya Yuga when Lord Nrsimhadev came here to rest after the assassination of Hiranyakasipu.

Near the temple is a lake, left over from the Mandakini River that once flowed here. When Lord Nrsimhadev came here, He used the sweet water of this river to quench his thirst and wash the blood of Hiranyakasipu from His hands.

The demigods came here after Nrsimhadev, and worshiped Him with great pomp. Visvakarma erected a temple here, and the demigods erected palaces around it. The Mandakini River, which over time changed the course, flooded and destroyed this city. All that remains of it is the small hills surrounding this place. Their names preserve the memory of ancient times: Surya-tila, Indra-tila, Ganesha-tila, Brahma-tila, Nrsimha-tila. Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that fragments of stones can still be found around them, from which the city of the demigods was built.

Sri Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya contains a prediction according to which in the future a king will build a huge temple for Nrsimhadeva, receiving a drop of His mercy.

Nrsimhadev is the protector of the devotees, but we should not ask him to become our free guard. Nrsimhadev protects us from the enemies inside our hearts - lust, anger and greed.
