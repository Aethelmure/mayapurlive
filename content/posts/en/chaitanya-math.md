Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati called this place Vrndavana Pattan - "The place where Vrindavan appeared." Math was founded by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in 1918 and for a long time was the headquarters from where the preaching of Krishna consciousness was spread throughout India. In the heyday of the Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati movement, up to 800 preacher devotees could live in the math.

### Main temple

The temple was built in 1923. On the central altar of this temple are the personal Deities of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati - Sri Sri Gandharvika-Giridhari. Next to Them there are two Deities of Lord Caitanya with their right hands raised. In niches, in the outer walls of the altar, the murti of the acharyas of the four Vaishnava sampradayas — Madhva, Ramanuja, Nimbarka and Vishnuswami — are installed. The Caitanya Mahaprabhu movement was called to unite the four sampradayas. It was predicted that a person would be born in Jagannatha Puri who would do this. This man was Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.

Jananivasa Prabhu: Gaitharvika-Giridhari Deities are installed in the Caitanya Math. These were the beloved Deities of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. When the devotees founded this math, they went to Jaipur to bring deities from there. They went to the shop to see what deities were being sold there. The seller told them:

\ - Over there your deities are standing in the corner.

Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati asked:

\ - How do you know that these are my deities?

\ - Last night I had a dream. These Deities came to me in a dream and said: “Tomorrow a mahapurusha will come here and want to buy Deities from you. We want him to serve us. ” So please take them. I want to give them to you.

### Shyama-kunda

Opposite Samadhi Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati is Shyama-kunda - the manifestation of Vrindavan Shyama-kunda in the land of Antardvipa.

### Radha Kunda

The manifestation of the original Radha-kunda. A beautiful little pond with lotuses blooming on it.

### Giri-govardhan

Govardhana in Caitanya Math

In the courtyard of Caitanya Math, in addition to Radha-kunda and Syama-kunda, Govardhana Hill also appeared. Parikrama around him brings the same benefit as parikrama around the original Govardhana, although it only takes a few minutes. On top of it is a small blue Krishna Deity.

### Printing press

An old printing press is stored in the math, on which books were printed during the time of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.
