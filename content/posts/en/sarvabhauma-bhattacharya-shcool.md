This place is located near [the house of Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya](/en/sarvabhauma-bhattacharya-house). Here, on the site of the Vidyanagar Gaudiya Math, there was once a school of Sarvabhauma. This small temple was opened by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. Here they worship the beautiful great Deities of Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai, who once served as Vidya Vachaspati - the brother of Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya. To the left of the temple is a small grove, the trees in which do not belong to any known species. They say that they grew out of pencils that Lord Caitanya left here when he came here to study.

### Raghunatha Shiromani
Raghunatha was a disciple of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. He lived and studied in Vidyanagar and was a great connoisseur of logic. Once he decided to write a book, a commentary on the work of the great logician Gangeshopadhyaya "Tattva-cintamani." This illustrious logician was the founder of the Nava-nyaya school, the “new logic” that Sarvabhauma taught. Raghunatha's book, Didhiti, was to glorify his name. He worked on it for a very long time, and when, finally, the manuscript was almost ready, the following happened to him.

Raghunatha crossed the Ganges by boat. Next to him sat Nimai Pandit.

\- "Listen, Raghunatha," He said. - Recently, I wrote a book on logic. Would you like to have a look?

The Lord spoke a little about His work, and Raghunatha turned pale. The book of Nimai almost completely repeated His own, but revealed a topic much broader and better explained the subject. The Lord, noticing his depressed state, asked:

\- Are you sad? Why? I thought you would like my book.

With a choked voice, Raghunatha replied:

\- I worked so hard, working on the same topic as You. My manuscript is almost finished, but now I see that all my work went to dust. Your book is much better ...

Lord Caitanya smiled, took out his manuscript and threw it into the water:

\- May your work be glorified all over the world.
