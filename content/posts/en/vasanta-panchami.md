This is the beginning of spring in India. The sastric instruction is that on the fifth day of the waxing moon one should celebrate the arrival of spring in Vrindavana by offering many types of leaves, flowers, and fresh shoots of sprouting grasses to Krishna. Vasanta-panchami is celebrated in Bengal too. This marks the beginning of new life with the full flowering of yellow mustard seed plants. At this time, flowers begin to bloom and nature displays her majestic finery.

Following the tradition, the Deities at Mayapur are dressed in yellow outfits and are offered yellow flowers. Many women can be seen in yellow dresses on this day. Vasanta-panchami is an auspicious day for beginning new projects. Weddings and fertility rites are also performed on this day.
