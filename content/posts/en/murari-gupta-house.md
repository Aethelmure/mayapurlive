Now this small temple is privately owned, and the person to whom it belongs willingly lets pilgrims go there.

The original Deities of Krishna and Radharani, whom Murari Gupta served, unfortunately, moved to another place. Now Sita, Rama, Lakshman and Hanuman are installed in the temple.

During the construction of this temple, a small stone deity of the four-armed Narayana was found in the ground. They say that It was sculpted in Satya Yuga, and Murari Gupta worshiped Him too.

Lord Caitanya and Murari Gupta pastimes.

Coming to the house of Murari Gupta, we pray that he will cure us of spiritual diseases.
