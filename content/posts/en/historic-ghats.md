### Mahaprabhu Ghat
Here, according to legend, Ganga-devi performed the severe penances to receive the same mercy as the Yamuna River, which witnessed many pastimes of Lord Krishna. The Lord, pleased with the Ganges, promised to appear on its banks in Kali-yuga.

This ghat was not far from the house of Jagannatha Misra, so Nimai spent a lot of time here swimming and playing in the waters of the sacred river, sometimes spending six to eight hours in a row there.

### Baracron Ghat
In the time of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, it was one of the most beautiful places of Navadvipa. This ghat was built at the direction of Krishna by Vishvakarma himself, the architect of the demigods, and five hundred years ago five temples of Shiva stood near him. The ghat was surrounded by gardens and decorated with winding flower vines, and the birdsong created a peaceful atmosphere in this place. Lord Caitanya came to this place with His disciples, and here, right on the banks of the Ganges, conducted classes. It was in this place that the famous Keshava Kashmiri was defeated.

### Vriddha Shiva-ghat
This area is called Shiva-doba and is located on the southern border of Antardvipa. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura describes this ghat in Sri Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya: “Vriddha Siva is the guardian of Mayapur. Here forever is PraudhaMaya, Yoga Maya (the energy responsible for spiritual perception). When our Lord leaves this world, according to His will the Ganges will leave the banks. Mayapur will almost hide its waters for hundreds of years, but then the water will recede. For some time there will be only bare, undeveloped land. Then, at the request of the Lord, this place will be glorified again, and people will begin to live in Mayapur, as before. All these ghats on the banks of the Ganges will appear again, and devotees will build the temples of the Lord here. "Proudha-Maya and Vriddha-Shiva will return and will, as before, reveal to people the spiritual face of the dhama, obeying the will of the Lord."

After the flood that destroyed the old temple near this ghat, the deities of Vridha Shiva and Praudha Maya were transferred to Kuliya Grama (now the city of Navadvipa), where they are worshiped to this day.

### Madhai Ghat
This ghat was built by Madhai, who gained the mercy of Lord Nityananda with his brother Jagai. This story is told in Caitanya Bhagavat.

### Nahariya Ghat
Lord Caitanya and his school friends ran here to bathe after school, when he was going home from the school of Pandit Gangadas. Here the Lord revealed such lilas.

### Ganganagara Ghat
This place, like other ghats, is not marked by anything. Now there is a field at this place, although, according to another opinion, the Ganganagara Ghat is now hidden by the waters of the Ganges.

Not far from this ghat were the houses of Pandit Gangadas and Sanjay das, and Lord Caitanya often came here.

Sri Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya tells the following story about this place.

King Bhagiratha of the Raghu Dynasty led the Ganga-devi to the resting place of his ancestors in order to cleanse them from the effects of the insult inflicted on Lord Kapiladeva. But, having reached this place, the Ganga-devi stopped. The king returned and saw that the personified Ganges was sitting, immersed in meditation. The king sat nearby and followed her example. After some time, she said to Bhagiratha:

“O Bhagiratha, my waters flow from the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, and here, in His holy abode, I want my desires to be fulfilled. In Phalguna Purnima, the day the Lord appears, my vow will be completed, and then I will follow you again.

Lord Nityananda said: "He who fasts on the day of Phalguna Purnima, bathes in this place in the Ganges and worships Gauranga Mahaprabhu, crosses the ocean of the material world with his ancestors."
