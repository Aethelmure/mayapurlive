Now Alakananda, like many other Navadvipa rivers, is filled only in the rainy season. At other times, it is a chain of small lakes located in its old channel.

The story of the parrot that happened here is described in the Prema Vivarta of Jagadananda Pandita.

### The story with the parrot
Once, Lord Caitanya and Jagadananda Pandita walked in this place. On the other side of the river, they saw a parrot sitting on a branch of a bakula tree.

Lord Caitanya said:

\ - You are Suka [this word means “parrot”, and also indicates Sukadeva Gosvami], and therefore you should sing about the glories of Radha and Krishna.

\ - Gaura! Gaura! The parrot sang.

Lord Caitanya covered his ears:

\- Not! You must sing the names of Radha and Krishna!

But the parrot danced and sang:

\ - Gaura! Gaura!

Lord Caitanya exclaimed:

\ - Do not you understand that this place is not different from Vrindavan ?! Here you should only glorify Radha and Krishna!

\ "Yes, this place is not different from Vrindavan," the parrot replied. “And I see how Radha and Krishna come together here in the form of Gauranga.” If you want, you can chant the names of Radha and Krishna, and I will chant the name of Their united incarnation: Gaura! Gaura!

Lord Caitanya left this place - He was in the mood of a devotee and did not want to hear the worship of Him. But this parrot knew who Gauranga really was.
