In this small village temple, Durga is worshiped as Simantini Devi. Unlike other deities of old Navadipa, Simantini Devi did not change her "place of residence", since this territory is the only one that was not affected by the strong change in the Ganga channel that occurred 100 years after the departure of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Recently, local devotees added a canopy for pilgrims to the temple. There is a 24-hour kirtan here at Gaura Purnima.

### History of Simantini Devi
This story is given in Sri Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya.

Once on Kailash, Lord Shiva chanted the names of Gauranga, and then began to dance in ecstasy. Parvati Devi asked him: “What kind of mantra are you repeating?” Shiva replied: “I sing the name of Gauranga. This is a special incarnation of the Lord that distributes pure love for Krsna. " Parvati also wanted to receive this love, and Shiva advised her to go to Navadvipa.

Arriving at this place, Parvati Devi began to chant the name of Gauranga. After some time, the Lord appeared before her in the form of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

His body was golden in color, and a garland of forest flowers hung on His neck that touched His lotus feet. The Lord's clothes were wet with tears - He cried out of love for Krsna. His hands reached the knees. He had big eyes like lotuses, and He Himself charmingly smiled. He was beautiful.

Seeing Him, Parvati bowed down to Him. She wanted to offer prayers, but her voice broke.

The Lord asked her:

\- Why did you come here? What do you want?

Parvati replied:

\- My husband told me that you are distributing love for Krsna to everyone. But I'm the only one who got nothing. I am very unfortunate. Pure Vaishnavas do not like to communicate with me and are called the “witch Maya”. I always lack communication with devotees. And I have no love for the Lord ... O Gauranga! Please give me love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna!

Lord Gauranga blessed her:

“Dear Devi, you are not different from Radharani.” You are shakti, My energy and part of My games.

With the blessing of Lord Caitanya, Parvati was able to realize that she was nondifferent from Radharani.

Parvati took the dust from the lotus feet of Gauranga and applied to her parting (shimantu). Therefore, this island is called Simantha Dvipa.

In the holy dham of Parvati, Maya-devi experiences the sincerity of the devotees. In this temple, you can pray Simantini devi to gain the mercy of Lord Caitanya. Just meditating here on this game, we will easily find His mercy.
