### Akshaya-tritiya
Akshaya-tritiya is an important day in Vedic culture as any donation performed on this day for the right cause is declared to yield inexhaustible results. Devotees consider this day as a reminder to surrender whatever they have in the service of Lord Krishna. It marks the beginning of Chandana-yatra.

### Chandana-yatra
Chandana-yatra is a festivity that runs for three weeks. To keep the Deities cool during time of scorching  summer Sun, devotees apply sandalwood paste (chandana) over Radha Madhava and other Deities. All devotees including children and pilgrims are offered a chance to grind chandana for the pleasure of the Deities. During  first week, both large and small Radha Madhava Deities are covered with chandana. During second and third week, small Radha Madhava Deities are entirely covered with chandana.
