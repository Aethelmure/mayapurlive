Srila Prabhupad’s Appearance Day is a very special day for all ISKCON devotees as they joyfully glorify their eternal saviour Srila Prabhupada on His appearance day.

Srila Prabhupada was sent by the Lord to fulfill Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s prediction- Prtvithe ache yata nagaradi grama, sarvatra pracara haibe more nama: In every town and village of the world, My name will be heard.

Srila Bhakti Vinoda Thakura wrote in his Sajjona-tosani, “Soon there will be a time when the chanting of Krishna’s name will be heard in England, France, Russia, Germany and America.”

Srila Prabhupada appeared on Nanadotsava. Nandotsava means: Nanda Maharaja’s huge festival celebrating Krishna’s birth. Nanda Maharaja dressed in luxurious garments and distributed profuse charity to everyone in his kingdom. He gave away opulent cloth and ornaments and two million richly decorated cows to the brahmanas. Vraja was alive with vibrations of Vedic hymns and beautiful decorations and everyone was experiencing unending happiness. Bursting with bliss, the Vrajavasis expressed their joy by throwing butter, yogurt and ghee all around.

One hundred years ago, on that most auspicious spiritual occasion, Srila Prabhupada appeared to fulfill the mission of Lord Krishna. Srila Prabhupada grew up as a pure devotee of the Lord and distributed Krishna Consciousness everywhere.

Srila Prabhupada made a perfect appearance, led a perfect life and had a perfect departure. Srila Prabhupada lives forever through his books. This legacy will always provide the devotees with Lord Caitanya katha and teach everyone to chant the Maha mantra.
