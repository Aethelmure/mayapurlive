There is a museum in Samadhi, in which miniatures present scenes from the life of Srila Prabhupada.

Also in the territory there is a book department and a shop with [mahaprasad](/en/glossary/#mahaprasad).

In the holy month of kartika in samadhi, wicks are offered to Lord Damodara.

The lake, which is located on the territory of Samadhi and is framed by the Temple, existed here from the very beginning, before construction. On some holidays, you can watch a beautiful action, as Srila Prabhupada is taken out of the Temple and boated.
