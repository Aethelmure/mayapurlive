The Kirtan Academy in Mayapur was opened in December 2013, after the organizers of the Kirtan Mela Mayapur were inspired to serve devotees even more, helping them to improve their ability to play instruments, singing, increase attractiveness and attachment to the Holy Name.

The Kirtan Academy offers a unique combination of learning to deepen your relationship with the Holy Name in the form of Japa and Kirtan, through the highly informative and transformative daily classes of Nam Tattva, along with daily kirtans and a weekly repetition of 64 circles. In addition, students intensively learn to play mridanga, karatals, harmonium and receive vocal lessons from the best teachers in order to be able to express their devotion with the help of a wonderful kirtan.

The spirit of the academy is “living education.” The practice and application of philosophy are important parts of the curriculum.

The study of bhajans, prayers and their deep meanings and meanings is also an important part. Songs of Srila Prabhupada, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, Srila Narottama das Thakur.

The narratives of Lord's pastimes “Lila Kirtan” are a regular part of the curriculum. Gaura lila, Krishna lila, Vaishnava lila, the history of the culture of the Vaishnava kirtan Gaudhiya over the past 500 years.

Daily classes are held on mrdanga, karatals, harmony and vocal training, so that our offerings to the Lord can become the most pleasant. Every day we gather either for social events or for programs organized by students of the academy, whose focus is on kirtan. This provides further practice for students.
