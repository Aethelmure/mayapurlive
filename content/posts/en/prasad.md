In the [Bhagavad-gita](/en/bhagavad-gita), [Krishna](/en/krishna) says that human being should only eat what was first offered to Him, otherwise there will be karmic consequences.

> "Offer Me a leaf, flower, fruit, or water, with love and devotion, and I will accept them." (BG 9.26)

From this line we can conclude that He accepts only simple vegetarian food prepared with love and devotion.

A person should think about the fact that he cannot produce food in his factories. We do not eat gasoline, plastic shavings or steel. The Lord gives us various foods that we eat, and sacrificing them is a form of recognition of our duty to him.

You should be very careful in choosing the products that we are going to offer to the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that food can refer to the various modes of material nature - virtue, passion, ignorance. Dairy products, sugar, vegetables, fruits, nuts and cereals belong to the mode of virtue and are accepted by Krishna. Food in the modes of passion and ignorance cannot be offered to Krishna. It is easy to guess that meat, fish and eggs belong to the lower gunas, like some vegetarian foods, such as garlic and onions. Coffee, cocoa, chocolate, and caffeinated tea also belong to the lower gunas.

When buying foods, you must remember that meat, fish, and eggs may be found in other foods, so read the labels carefully. Food prepared by non-Krishna bhaktas should also be avoided. In accordance with the subtle laws of nature, the cook has influence on food not only physically, but also morally.
