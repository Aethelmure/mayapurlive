The divine appearance day of Srimati Radharani, the eternal consort of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Radhastami is a very special day for all the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, as by obtaining the mercy of Srimati Radharani one can easily achieve Krishna-prema. Radha is Krishna’s dearest servant, and is His pleasure potency.

Srimati Radharani’s glorious birth occured on the eighth day of the bright moon in the month of Bhadra. Although generally not full on that day, the moon appeared full to celebrate Radharani’s appearance in this world. Among all of Krishna’s consorts in Sri Vrindavana, Srimati Radharani is the greatest. In fact, She is the queen of Vrndavana. At Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir, we are fortunate to also worship Her eight dearest friends Lalita, Tungavidya, Chitra, Champakalata, Vishakha, Indulekha, Rangadevi and Sudevi.

As with Balarama-purnima and Janmashtami, an adhivasa ceremony to prepare the devotees is conducted on the eve of Radhashtami.

On Radhashtami day, a new outfit is offered to Srimati Radharani and the temple is lavishly decorated with flowers and garlands. Srimati Radharani’s glories are narrated in the morning Bhagavatam class. A maha-abhisheka is performed at noon with a variety of ingredients and many colorful flowers. Devotee men and women in the Deity kitchen an elaborate bhoga with more than 100 varieties along with many sweet dishes, pastries, and cakes. After the abhisheka, bhoga is offered and maha-arati is performed. Devotees fast till noon and enjoy a transcendental feast in the afternoon.

Cultural programs are presented in the evening to enchant the visitors and devotees.
