The appearance place of the Lord is known as Yoga Pitha, and is situated at the very center of Mayapur. "Yoga" means connection, "Yoga Pitha" means the place where the Lord connects Himself to this earth, or descends to this earth. This is the home of Jagannatha Mishra. Another meaning of Yoga Pitha is "a meeting place." At this place all the associates of the Lord meet with Him to participate in His pastimes.   In 1893, Bhaktivinoda Thakura established Yoga Pitha as the actual site of Lord Caitanya's appearance. He personally collected the funds to purchase this land and built a small temple here. This was completed in 1906 at which time he also installed the deities of Gaura-Narayana and His two wives, Laksmipriya and Vishnupriya.

Bhaktivinoda Thakura's son and spiritual successor, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, built the present temple in 1934. It was inaugurated on Gaura-Purnima day in 1953 at which time Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura installed the remaining Deities on the left and right altars.

Directions:Turn right outside the main gate of ISKCON and proceed down Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Marga for one kilometer. Yoga Pttha is on the right side of the road and has an ornate main gate. A rickshaw there and back costs about Rs 20.

Presiding Deities:
  1. On the right side just inside the main gate is a small temple where Bhaktivinoda Thakura is worshiped.

  2. A few steps ahead on the left are the main temple which has 100 feet high tower. In this temple on the left altar are Sri Sri Radha-Madhava and Lord Caitanya. On the central altar is Gaura Narayana with His two wives, Lakshmipriya on His right and Vishnupriva on His left. You can also see a small blackish Deity approximately eight inches high on this altar. This is Adhoksaja Vishnu was discovered in 1934 by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati during the excavation for the temple. The Adhoksaja Vishnu deity worshiped by Jagannatha Mishra, Lord Caitanya's father. This Deity shows Lord Vishnu with His four arms holding the disc, club, lotus, and conchshell along with His saktis Bhu Devi and Lakshmi Devi on each side. You may have to ask to see this Deity. The right altar has Panchatattva and Lord Jagannatha.

  3. A few steps to the right of the main altar are the neem tree where Lord Caitanya appeared. It is said that this tree comes directly from a cutting of the original tree. Next to the tree is a small mud hut with deities of Jagannatha Mishra and Sachimata holding young Nimai on her lap. This is a reconstruction of Jagannatha Mishra's house that Nimai grew up in.

  4. Ten meters (30 feet) south from the appearance place (directly behind the mud hut) is a Small temple with two Shiva Lingas. The smaller one on the left is Gopishvara Shiva who admits one to the Lord's service. The larger one on the right is Ksetrapala Siva who is the protector of the Dhama. It is recommended that the devotees pray to these Deities at the beginning of their Parikrama (or of their stay in Mayapur) that the Dhama and Gaura Prema be revealed within their hearts.

  5. Again to the right, at the end of the property, are deities of Gaura-Gadadhara and Laksmi Narshima deva who were installed by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura.

  6. Gaura Kunda, on the side of the temple, has been compared in its glories to Radha Kunda and Svarna Kunda in Vrindavana. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura excavated it in 1920.
