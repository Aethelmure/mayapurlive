The Mayapur Agriculture Department aims to supply organic grains and produce for the Deity kitchen so that Sri Sri Radha-Madhava can enjoy foodstuffs which
are pure and naturally grown, and in the future, to cultivate enough for all the other kitchens of Mayapur. These projects are part of a long-term vision
to manifest Srila Prabhupada's instructions that the whole of Mayapur be self-sufficient.
