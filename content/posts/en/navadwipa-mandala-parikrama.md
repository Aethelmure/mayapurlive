From an ordinary person’s point of view, Navadvipa is a small geographical area located at the confluence of the Ganges (Bhagirathi) and Jalanga rivers at 23.25 ° north latitude and 88.22 ° east longitude, in the district of Nadia, West Bengal, India. The name “Navadvipa” is translated as “nine islands” and is due to the fact that the Ganges flowing through these lands in the past was divided here into several branches, thus forming nine islands.

### Antardvipa
Antardvipa is the central island of Navadvipa, which is compared to a cup of lotus. Its core is Yogapith, the site of the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the center of the spiritual world and Gauda-mandala-bhumi. Antardvipa corresponds to atma-nivedanam - complete surrender to the Lord.

### Simantadvipa
Simantadvipa corresponds to such a process of devotional service as sravana - hearing.

### Godrumadvipa
This island - the third island of Navadvipa-dhama personifies the kirtans, chanting the holy name of the Lord. It is located on the eastern bank of the Ganges and extends from Devapalli to the Jalanga River. The name "Godrumadvipa" comes from the words go - "cow", drum - "tree" and dvipa - "island" and is associated with the history of the cow of Surabha.

### Madhyadvipa
Madhyadvipa personifies smaranam. The Nectar of Devotion describes many rules, but in the end it is said that the goal of following them is to achieve constant remembrance of the Lord. This island represents smaranam, and here one has to plunge into thoughts of Krsna. We can remember Krsna and Gauranga, Their pastimes and the supernatural activities that They performed.

### Coladvipa
This area is called Varaha-ksetra or Kuliyapahada. It is not different from Govardhana and, like in Vrindavan, in the north of this region is the forest of Bahulavan, and in the south - rasa-sthali, the place where the Lord reveals rasa-lila. Otherwise, this place is called Koladvipa-parvata, because in ancient times Lord Varaha revealed the glories of Gauranga to His devotee Vasudeva.

### Ritudvipa
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur writes: “Ritudvipa is the abode of spiritual bliss. She is a reflection of the surroundings of Radha-kunda in Vraja. " The word ritu means spring. Although all the seasons are simultaneously present in the “spiritual” Navadvipa, eternal spring reigns on this island. Locals call the island "Ratupura".

### Jahnudvipa
This island is not different from Bhadravana, one of the twelve forests of the Vraja Mandala, in which Lord Krishna and Balarama played with their friends. Jahnudwipa is now called Jannagara. Of the nine methods of devotional service, Jahnudvipa is related to vandanas - the offering of prayers. The scriptures contain many wonderful prayers with which devotees turned to the Lord.

  - [Jahnu Muni Ashram](/en/jahnu-muni-ashram/)

### Modadrumadvipa
Modadrumadvipa is not different from Bhandiravana. Bhaktivinoda Thakura writes: “This forest is not different from Sri Bhandiravana in Vraja, where both the birds and the beasts are spiritual ... O Bhandiravana, the land of spiritual treasures, my heart is torn apart from separation from you! In that place, in the guise of the shepherds, Krishna and Balarama manifested Their many pastimes. Here, in Modadrum, accompanied by friends, Gauranga played His games, intoxicated by the sounds of kirtan. ”

### Rudradvipa
This island represents sakhyam - friendship with the Lord. Rudradvipa is considered the island of Lord Siva, for it is closely connected with his games. Bhaktivinoda Thakura writes: “This island is nothing but Kailasa, the eternal abode of Lord Siva, hidden in the forests of Navadvipa. The tiny part of its radiance illuminates all three worlds ”(Navadvipa-bhava-taranga, 132).
