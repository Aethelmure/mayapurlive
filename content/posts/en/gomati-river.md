In the Sri Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya Pramana Khanda, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur writes: “... Navadvipa is surrounded by the pure and holy waters of the Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu, Kaveri, Tamrapaparni, Payasvini Dimitas, Kritam, Kritam and other sacred rivers. "

All the places of pilgrimage that exist in the world are present in Navadvipa Dham, which is the source and highest of all the holy places. This also applies to sacred rivers. Many of them have disappeared from view over time, and now they are revealed only to the gaze of pure devotees. Some, such as Alakananda, disappeared “partially”, leaving behind a channel and several lakes.

The Gomati, flowing through the territory of Madhyadvipa, is indistinguishable from the Gomati River in the state of Uttar Pradesh, which flows near the sacred forest of Naimisaranya and is considered sacred itself.

Bhaktivinoda Thakur writes: “The Garga-Samhita glorifies Naimi-ksetra in Madhyadvipa (where the Gomati River flows):” He who takes the sacred dust from the banks of the Gomati River is freed from sins accumulated over hundreds of lives. There is no doubt about it ... If during the month of Magha, during Makar-sankranti, a person takes bath in the Gomati River, this is a thousand times more beneficial than bathing in Prayag. Even Lord Brahma cannot properly glorify Gomati with his four mouths. ”

Gomati is now practically invisible. From it there was only a lake.
