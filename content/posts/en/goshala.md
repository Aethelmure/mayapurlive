Currently, the goshala contains a herd of more than 350 cows, bulls, calves and oxen. Along with providing cows with medical care, food, clean water and lifetime accommodation, the goshala also seeks to inspire pilgrims visiting Sri Dham Mayapur to love and protect the cows by implementing a cow protection program in accordance with the teachings of [Srila Prabhupada](/en/srila-prabhupada).

Goshala is open to visitors, you can come to pet the cows and feed them.
