This is a small temple, only thirty meters from [Srivas-angan](/en/srivas-angan). Once there was the house of Advaita Acharya, who lived in Shantipur most of the time, but he also had a house in Navadvip.

On the altar of this temple are the Deities of Lord Caitanya and Advaita Acarya, who is depicted as sitting and worshiping the Lord.

### Lord comes to Advaita’s house
Visvarupa, the elder brother of Lord Caitanya, was a frequent guest at Advaita Acarya's house. He came to the glorious saint and spent whole days with him, listening to krsna-katha. Lord Gauranga was at that time still a little boy. Once, mother of Saci sent Him for Visvarupa:

\- Run to Advaita’s house and bring your brother!

Gauranga rushed to Advaita Acharya’s house, where at that time many exalted devotees gathered (among them was Srivasa Pandita). They all sat around Advaita Acarya and listened carefully to his words. Smiling, the Lord said:

\- Brother, let's go to dinner soon!

Little Gauranga was so charming that devotees forgot everything and seemed to drink with their eyes the beauty of His face.

Since then, little Visvambhara began to resort to Advaita Acharya every day, and Advaita, looking at Him, felt his heart melt. “This is probably my Lord, for who else could have excited me so much with their beauty?” He thought to himself. And Lord Visvambhara, understanding Advaita’s thoughts, hurriedly ran away.
