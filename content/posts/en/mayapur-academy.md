The Mayapur Academy was opened to satisfy Srila Prabhupada's desire to develop Deity worship and brahminical culture in ISKCON. And, thanks to the creation of such a perfect educational center for teaching the brahminical culture, arts and sciences, worship of the Deities, cooking, samskaras and much more in Mayapur, this desire will undoubtedly be fulfilled.

### About the Academy
Mayapur Academy is open to all initiated devotees.

If you want to come and take a course, you need to go to the website of the Mayapur Academy and fill out the registration form in English. To do this, you need to indicate which course you want to take, certified or certified (more on this in the second part of the article); indicate the language in which you would like to take the course, Russian or English; your name, address, phone, email and attach a copy of your passport. After reviewing your registration form, you will be contacted by phone or email.

### History
In 1972, Srila Prabhupada instructed Jananivas Prabhu to "prepare pujari." And since then, for 35 years, Jananivas Prabhu has been steadily worshiping Sri Sri Radha Madhava and teaching others this art. But, he felt that this service could be done much better and more productively, for example, by systematically training large groups of devotees from around the world.

Seeing the successful influence of Deity worship courses during the Mayapur festival, Jananivas Prabhu turned to Nrsimha Kavaca Prabhu and asked him: “When will we open such a school?” So the idea of ​​creating a specialized academy teaching brahminical culture in Mayapur came up.

After several years of planning, creating a curriculum and building a building, the Mayapus Academy opened on December 7, 2007. EM Jayapataka Swami and EM Jayadvaita Swami were present as guests of honor and jointly cut the ribbon. Speaking, Jayapataka Swami said: “Like a dream come true! Indeed, the desire of Prabhupada was to teach the pancaratric system here in Mayapur. ”

### Opportunities
Mayapur Academy has everything necessary for training - classrooms are decorated according to the directions of the course. There is a room for learning to dress the Deities with all the necessary kits, a room for learning to cook the Deities, a room for lectures and a library with an ever-growing collection of books.

The first-class capabilities of the Mayapur Academy enable each student to study in a clean and organized environment and benefit most from courses in brahminical culture.

Mayapur Academy is located on the second floor of Caitanya Bhavan, within walking distance of the Radha Madhava Temple.

### Library
The library of the Mayapur Academy has a wide selection of books in different languages ​​on Vaishnava philosophy and culture. Devotees coming to Mayapur can come and study these books.

The Academy has computers for training and viewing selected videos and other materials.

The library is open daily from 10.00 to 17.00 (except Sunday)

If you have Vaishnava books that you want to donate, the library will gladly accept them for serving devotees.
