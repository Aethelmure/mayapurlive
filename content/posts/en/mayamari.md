Mayamari is not far from [Jagannath Temple](/en/jagannath-temple), on the banks of Jalanga. It is believed to be indistinguishable from the Talavan forest in Vrindavan.

The history of this place is told in Sri Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya. Lord Balarama, making His pilgrimage, came to Navadvipa and stopped here to rest. Local brahmanas told Him of a demon named Maya, who caused many disturbances to the inhabitants of these places. Balarama went to this demon, and after a long battle he killed him. Since then, this place has been called Mayamari.
