Chand Kazi Samadhi is not far from [Yogapith](/en/yogapith). At one time, it served as a guideline that helped to prove the truth of the discovery made by Bhaktivinoda Thakur. Samadhi is a low stone structure located in a small courtyard. Two trees grow directly from it - champaka and him. The first of them is more than 500 years old, which means it has witnessed the pastimes of Lord Caitanya at this place. The trunk of this tree is empty from the inside, however, the tree continues to grow and bring flowers all year round. Around champaka wrapped himself around him. It is believed that champaka symbolizes Chanda Kazi himself, and the tree symbolizes Lord Caitanya, who embraced His great devotee. Devotees call champaku Kalpa-vriksha - a tree that fulfills spiritual desires. Walking around these trees, you can ask them to fulfill your spiritual desires.

### Chand Kazi
[Srila Prabhupada](/en/srila-prabhupada) in his commentary on the Caitanya Charitamrita provides details of the historical situation in Bengal five centuries ago. Among other things, he writes: “At that time (1498-1521 CE), independent king Nabob Hussein Shah ruled Bengal, whose full name was Ala Uddin Sayyad Husen Sa. In his youth, he was a servant of a cruel nabob from the Habsi dynasty named Mujafara Khan, but later he managed to kill his master and become king himself. Having ascended the throne of Bengal (called Masnada), he began to call himself Sayyad Husen Ala Uddin Serif Mukka. In a book called Riyaja Us-Saladina, the author, Golam Husen, claims that Nabob Hussein Shah came from the Mukka Serif family. To revive the glory of his kind, he took this surname for himself. However, he is usually known by the name of Nabob Hussein Shah. After his death, Bengal began to be ruled by his eldest son Nasarats (1521-1523). This king was also famous for his cruelty. He has committed many crimes against Vaisnavas. His sins led one of his servants from the Khodja group to kill him during prayer in a mosque.

Phujadara, or city magistrate, was called kaji (kazi). The so-called jamidars (zamindars), or landowners (mandaliers), collected taxes on land ownership, and the kazi monitored order and punished criminals. The kazi and zamindars themselves obeyed the authority of the ruler of Bengal, who at that time was called Suba-bangala. Nadia, Islamampur and Bagoyan were run by a zamindar named Hari Hora, and then his descendant Hora Krishnadasa. It is said that Chhand Qazi was the spiritual mentor of Nabob Hussein Shah. According to some information, his name was Mullah Shirajuddin, according to others - Habibar Rahman. The descendants of Chanda Kazi still live in the vicinity of Mayapur, and the pilgrims to this day come to the tomb of Chanda Kazi, which is located under the Champaka tree and is called "Samadhi Chanda Kazi ..."

In Krishna’s pastimes, Chand Kazi was Kamsa, therefore the place where his house was located is not different from Mathura. Lord Krsna gave Kamsa liberation with a fist, and having come as Lord Caitanya, he awarded him Krishna-prema.
