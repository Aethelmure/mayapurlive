- Organizing all practitioners in small groups for intimate exchanges and the building of friendly relation; regular supervision and support.
- Temples as tirthas for inspiration and exemplary behavior; enthusing large gatherings and festivals.
- Ongoing systematic training and education.

To facilitate these objectives, CDM:

- design and present courses.
- produce, translate and circulate books, articles, supporting materials & audiovisuals.
- assist in organizing festivals & conventions.
- remain updated on innovations and trends from both inside and outside ISKCON.
