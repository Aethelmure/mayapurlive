In the very heart of Mayapur - the world center of Vedic spiritual culture - an extraordinary temple is being built, which, according to the predictions by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, will change the fate of the world. The authorities of Vedic knowledge say that it is after the opening of the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium that the long-awaited Golden Age will come - the revival of spirituality on the whole planet.

The Great Saint of our time [A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada](/en/srila-prabhupada), bequeathing the construction of this temple to his disciples, gave the order to build it on voluntary contributions collected around the world, in every point of our long-suffering planet.

Srila Prabhupada had a clear idea of ​​what the new temple should be like. As evidence, we have left his numerous statements, instructions and explanations. He wanted the Vedic Planetarium to have no equal, revealing to people the Vedic concept of universe. The temple should become the hallmark of the ancient Vedic culture, reviving today.
Combining modern technology, ancient science, eternal wisdom and living culture, the temple promises to become a popular center of spiritual life on Earth.

Srila Prabhupada had a clear vision of the temple of the Vedic planetarium, which he often shared. By building this center, he wanted to show the Vedic perspective of life, including a grandiose demonstration of the material and spiritual worlds that can be viewed while traveling around the planetarium. Prabhupada wanted to create something amazing and innovative that could attract people from all over the world to Mayapur.
