In 1973, [Srila Prabhupada](/en/srila-prabhupada) moved from [Bhajan Kutir](/en/bhajan-kutir) to these 2 rooms on the 2nd floor of the Lotus building.

The furniture in the rooms is the same as during the life of His Divine Grace.

One of these rooms is Srila Prabhupada's office, where he wrote books and performed darshanas. The second is for sleeping and taking [prasadam](/en/prasad). In the first room, you can read [japa](/en/japa) with Srila Prabhupada from 10:00 to 13:00 and from 16:30 to 20:00. The rest of the time the room is closed, but the furniture can be seen through the windows.
