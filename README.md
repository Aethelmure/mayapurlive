# Mayapur Live

Hare Krishna! All glories to Srila Prabhupada.

Thank you for your interest in Mayapur Live - site about Sri Dham Mayapur and it's community.

Site is currently under construction and is released as beta version to gather feedback. We are working hard on content creation and web development.
This site is our humble attempt to serve in Srila Prabhupada’s mission to spread the Sankirtan movement of Sri Caitanya Mahāprabhu all over the world.

If you have some professional skills in the fields of web development(React.js, Gatsby.js) or have good HD photos of Mayapur places - you are welcome to contribute.

Process of contribution is in the design phase. Soon there will be a guide, how everyone(even without skills) can help!
Like spread information about the site in social networks, review and share posts, make a donation and so on.

In mean time, please pray for us, so we can proceed.🙏

Your servants,
Mayapur Live team
